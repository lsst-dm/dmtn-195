description: "This technote sets out a set of desired features, and then in a subsequent version, a proposed implementation, for the use of the ASDF YAML data serialization for the representation of WCS data in FITS files containing multiple images, with multiple extensions per image.

The ultimate aim of this technote might be to stimulate the creation of a registered FITS convention for this application.

Both the Rubin Observatory and the NASA SPHEREx project are interested in defining such a data format rigorously and enabling users and client software to interpret them uniformly with the use of community open-source software tools, in multiple languages."
